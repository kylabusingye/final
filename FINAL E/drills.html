<h2>Closing Out & Drive with "Hips Across" Finish Drill</h2>
     <p>Objective:This drill focuses on improving defensive skills, closing out on offensive players, and executing a specific finishing move at the rim.</p>
        <p>Setup:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Two guards, one acting as the offensive player (with a basketball) and the other as the defender.</li>
        <li>- The offensive player starts on the perimeter, and the defender is positioned in a defensive stance a few feet away.</li>
    </ul>
          
<p>Execution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> 1. The offensive player makes a move towards the basket, simulating an attempt to drive past the defender.</li>
        <li> 2. The defender practices closing out quickly, maintaining a low defensive stance and attempting to prevent the offensive player from driving to the basket.</li>
        <li> 3. If the offensive player successfully starts driving, the defender must execute a defensive slide and stay in front.</li>
        <li> 4. The offensive player, upon reaching the vicinity of the rim, performs a move called "hips across." This involves using a lateral movement of the hips to create separation from the defender and finish the drive at the rim.</li>
        <li>5. Players switch roles after each repetition to practice both offensive and defensive skills.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h2>Man-to-Man Defensive Rotation Drill</h2>
<p>Objective:This drill is designed to enhance players' understanding of man-to-man defense principles and improve their ability to rotate and communicate effectively.</p>
     <p>Setup:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>- Players are divided into offensive and defensive teams, with each defensive player assigned to guard a specific offensive player.</li>
     <li>- The offensive team is set up with players in various positions on the court, and the defensive team starts in a man-to-man defensive alignment.</li>
    </ul>
       
    <p>Execution:</p>
     <ul>
      <li> 1. The coach initiates ball movement among the offensive players, simulating a dynamic offensive play.</li>
      <li>2. Defensive players must communicate, switch, and rotate as needed to defend against the offensive actions.</li>
      <li>3. Emphasis is placed on maintaining proper defensive positioning, communicating switches, and closing out on shooters.</li>
      <li>4. The drill may involve specific scenarios, such as defending against screens or helping and recovering.</li>
      <li> 5. Coaches provide feedback on defensive rotations, communication, and overall execution.</li>
      <li> 6. Players rotate roles to ensure everyone has a chance to practice both offensive and defensive aspects of the drill.</li>
     </ul>
