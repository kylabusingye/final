                                                The Gayaza Girls basketball team, based in Uganda, faces challenges in their skills and performance during games. Despite putting in effort, they struggle to connect tactics on the court, affecting motivation and participation. The majority of players express a desire to improve and participate in the Junior National Basketball Association (Jr. NBA) program, scheduled for February 2024 in Kampala. The lack of communication and collaboration within the team, exacerbated by gender inequalities in sports, creates a need for a solution to enhance their skills and team cohesion. Coached by male instructors, the girls require a strategy that aligns with their specific needs and bridges the gender gap in sports.</p>

Nicole's experience in international tournaments has shaped her passion and performance, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and adaptation to challenges. The team serves as a potential resource for the Gayaza Girls, providing insights into effective communication, teamwork, and strategies for success. The coaches, also male, present a potential disconnect in understanding the nuances of female basketball players, contributing to the lack of interconnection.</P>
